# hello-world
My name is Jackson and I am a junior studying Marketing and Business Analytics. I'm from Cedar Falls, Iowa and I have a dog named Chance.

# Project Title
Jackson's Hello World

# Description
This is a sample of how I would make a GitHub repository. I am practicing using the _Markdown syntax_.

# How to Run Program
This is where I would put instructions on how to run the program.

# Files Used
This is where I would insert the files I used with links for ease of access, such as [this picture of a dog](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fww2.kqed.org%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F39%2F2012%2F04%2Fdog-nose-resize.jpg&tbnid=RcPyu5mw2CH36M&vet=12ahUKEwiis9nQla6EAxU23MkDHVl3BioQMygMegQIARB8..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqed.org%2Fquest%2F36526%2Fthe-dogs-nose-knows-sensor-mimics-canine-sniffing-cells-for-smells&docid=P4nxXhKIhddYiM&w=640&h=360&q=link%20for%20a%20picture%20of%20a%20dog&ved=2ahUKEwiis9nQla6EAxU23MkDHVl3BioQMygMegQIARB8).
